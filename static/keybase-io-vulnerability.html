<h2>Keybase.io Vulnerability</h2><p>You can read about the issue I discovered at Keybase.io here: <a href="https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/397">Vulnerability Report</a>.</p><p>Due to the font they chose, I could impersonate any user with a zero, capital "o", lowercase "L", or capital "i" in their name. The details were iffy, I would also need to be able to register a twitter and github with the same name.</p></p><p>This might not initially sound like a significant finding, but below are two images that show just how serious this vulnerability is.</p><img style="max-width:400px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2739058/2540704/376b3ff2-b5d6-11e3-8dd2-df438157d3c5.png"/><img style="max-width:400px;display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2739058/2540705/3b1eafc6-b5d6-11e3-8044-6cb8f1c7ed9d.png"/><p>I was able to almost perfectly impersonate the co-founder of the site. One thing I accidently did was register "maigorithms" instead of "maLgorithms" on keybase. This was because I had just typed "maigorithms" twice on twitter and github.</p><h2>The problem they can't fix</h2><p>There is a certain problem keybase is unable to resolve. Keybase users may expect a user to on keybase to have the same keybase account name (and url) as twitter and github. For example, "<i>http://twitter.com/ev</i>" - Is the founder of twitter.<i>http://keybase.io/ev</i> - Is me, with a picture from the real ev's twitter.</p><p>What happens when I verify a github as ev as well? <i>How many hits would keybase.io/ev get of users expecting to find the owner of twitter.com/ev</i>.</p><p>This isn't a technical problem...it is a people problem. Obviously it is the users job to not trust and verify, but what happens when the user falls into the trap of trust?</p><p><i>ejj, March 2014</i></p>
